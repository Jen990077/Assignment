		<h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
		<h2>My name is Jennifer Leverenz.</h2>

		<p>
    I’m from Streetsboro, Ohio. I lived in Streetsboro my whole entire life. I work at Dairy Queen in Streetsboro. 
    I have been at Dairy Queen for three years. I like working there. It's not a hard job but I really want my IT degree.   
    </p>
    <p>
    The first interesting thing about me is that I love being computer: 
		</p>
		<li>Facebook</li>
		<li>Playing game(candy crush)</li>
		<li>Learning more about the computer</li>
		
		<p>
		 The second interesting thing about me is that I love to travel to different states:
		</p> 
  
		<ul>
			<li>Tennessee</li>
			<li>Texas</li>
			<li>North Carolina</li>
			<li>Pennsylvania</li>
		</ul>
  <p>
  The reason why I’m taking this class is to help me get closer to my IT degree!
